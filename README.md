# Digital Adaptation of Boris Yarkho's Research on the Works of Pierre Corneille 

This repository investigates the work of Boris Yarkho _Comedies and Tragedies of Corneille_ and attempts to recreate his calculations on his original corpus of French dramatic texts (_corneille-corpus-analysis.ipynb_) and an extended corpus (_extended-corpus-analysis.ipynb_). Along with the analyses, this repository also contains the corpora.

Some functions are situated in the _dracoranalysis.py_ file.

Topic modeling's results are dealt with in _topics.ipynb_. _preprocessed_ folder contains Corneille's plays gone through the FreEM TreeTagger model.

_wordclouds_ folder contains 30 images of the resulting topic wordclouds.

_preprocessed_topics_30_full.txt_ contains information on word distribution of the 30 topics.
