# Digital Adaptation of Boris Yarkho's Research on the Works of Pierre Corneille 

This repository investigates the work of Boris Yarkho _Comedies and Tragedies of Corneille_ and attempts to recreate his calculations on his original corpus of French dramatic texts (_corneille-corpus.ipynb_) and an extended corpus (_extended-corpus.ipynb_).
